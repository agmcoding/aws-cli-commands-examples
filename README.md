# AWS CLI Commands Examples

## Hi there

## Summary of this project

In this project, I created examples of AWS CLI (Command-Line Interface) version 2 commands. These examples can be copied and adapted to the required tasks you need with AWS services. 

In each directory, you will find the script and markdown files.

The `.sh` (bash script) files are the commands and the values for the options can be changed to correspond with what you need, as well as adding and removing options.

The `.md` (Markdown) files explain each command presented and its options. Those show which options are required and some non required but also useful for other purposes, like options `--timeout`, `--region`, `--output` and `--description`.

Here are some examples 
* Using and calling a Lambda function, listing and getting information  
* Creating a Rest API resource, creating a resource and adding a HTTP method
* Adding a new table in DynamoDB and listing table names
* Creating a IAM user, groups and attaching policies
* Creating a Cognito user pool and adding a Cognito Authorizer to API Gateway

## Which tools are been used

Linux, Bash scripts, AWS CLI version 2 commands, VIM (Vi Improved) programmer's text editor, Java programming language for Lambda function.
